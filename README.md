# Remove If Found Instructions  
```md 
Write the function removeIfFound() which removes all copies of a particular value from an array.
The function returns the number of values removed.
Here's a short example:

The example shown here removes all copies of the value 10 from the array a.

Both a and size are modified by the function. In this case, since there are two copies of 10,
size is changed to 6 and the function returns 2.

"Be especially careful when writing your code
that you don't skip values that are contiguous in the array."

For instance, if you remove 2 from {1, 2, 2, 2, 1}, you should end up with {1, 1}.
